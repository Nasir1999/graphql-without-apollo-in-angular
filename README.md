#  graphql-without-apollo-in-angular ✌

This is just an angular component with a service, For Graphql Test in Angular without setting up any environment like Apollo etc. You can use it with your backend, by just chaging baseurl of your service in `gql-test.service.ts`, Its Working Perfectly Fine 👌😍.
